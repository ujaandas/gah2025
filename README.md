# Great Agent Hack 2025

### Unit testing for LangGraph workflows

PROJ allows you to test and red-team your LangGraph agent systems by exposing APIs to individual nodes (i.e, agents, tools), or subsets thereof - without rerunning your entire workflow each time.

In essence, testing complex LangGraph agents can be extremely difficult, and more often than not, are merely treated as black-boxes. PROJ allows developers and non-developers alike to set custom inputs (via prompt injection), outputs, cycles and chains between your nodes to test and verify expected behaviour.

PROJ lets you:

- Test individual nodes with custom inputs
- Run subgraphs in isolation
- Mock expensive LLM calls
- Validate state transformations
- Visualize execution paths
